This project implements variety of sorting algorithms and users can choose one. All algorithms implements Sorter
interface, so there will be no effect even if you choose to use different sorting.
Algorithms implemented:

- InsertionSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- ShutaShibueSort

ShutaShibueSort is the combination of QuickSort and InsertionSort. It executes two rounds of Partition action in quicksort to move elements close to its final place, and then finish with insertionsort which should be faster with half-sorted array.
